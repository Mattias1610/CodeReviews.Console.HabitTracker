ConsoleHabitTracker

It is my first C# application in which I use SQLite and Visual Studio Code.
Console base CRUD application to track your habits. Developed using C# and SQLite.

Requirements
	•	This is an application where you’ll log occurrences of a habit.
	•	This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
	•	Users need to be able to input the date of the occurrence of the habit
	•	The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
	•	When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
	•	It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
	•	The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
	•	You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
	•	You can only interact with the database using ADO.NET. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework or Dapper.
	•	Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works.

Features

	•	SQLite database connection.
	•	Console based UI where you can navigate by pressing keys.
	•	CRUD features.
	•	See the sum of the quantities.

Challenges

	•	The Visual Studio Code interface and SQLite features.
